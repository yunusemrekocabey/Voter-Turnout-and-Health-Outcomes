## Abstract

This project aims to analyze the relationship between voting turnout and infant mortality rates, focusing on the United States. While it's often assumed that democratic societies exhibit better health outcomes, this research investigates the specific correlation between voter turnout and changes in infant mortality rates using a difference-in-differences analysis. Surprisingly, the study reveals that the decrease in infant mortality rates in states with higher voter turnout is not significantly different from those with lower voter turnout. These findings suggest that higher voter turnout does not necessarily correlate with lower infant mortality rates.

## Literature Review

The project reviews several academic works discussing the correlation between political regimes and health outcomes. References include research on "Health and Democracy," "The effects of dictatorship on health: the case of Turkmenistan," "Health and political regimes: Evidence from quantile regression," "Making sense of dictatorships and health outcomes," and "Spending on primary healthcare in two government administrations in Chile since the dictatorship." These studies examine the impact of political regimes, including democracies and dictatorships, on health outcomes, offering insights into the complex relationship between governance and public health.

## Introduction

The introduction section highlights the significance of democracy in placing people at the forefront of governance. It emphasizes the role of voter turnout as a fundamental aspect of democratic participation. The study proposes the use of voter turnout data as a simple democracy index to assess its potential impact on infant mortality rates. While higher voter turnout is often associated with improved democracy, the paper aims to investigate its specific influence on infant mortality, thereby exploring the relationship between political participation and health outcomes.

## Data Analysis

### An Overview

The data analysis section provides an overview of the data used in the research, including voter turnout data, infant mortality data, percentage of GDP data, and life expectancy data. Visual representations, such as tables, maps, and graphs, are utilized to depict changes in voter turnout rates and infant mortality rates across different states in the United States. The analysis offers preliminary insights into the patterns and trends present in the data, providing a basis for the subsequent difference-in-differences analysis.

### Difference-in-Differences Analysis

The difference-in-differences analysis is employed to assess the causal effect of changes in voter turnout on changes in infant mortality rates. States are categorized into treatment and control groups based on their voter turnout changes. The analysis reveals the differences in infant mortality rates between the two groups, indicating the impact of voter turnout changes on the observed health outcomes. The results of the analysis are presented through visualizations and statistical estimations, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the relationship under investigation.

### Difference-in-Differences Analysis with Regression

The project further utilizes regression analysis to validate the findings of the difference-in-differences approach. By applying a regression model, the study quantifies the specific effect of changes in voter turnout on infant mortality rates. The statistical analysis provides an estimate for the differential impact and assesses its significance through hypothesis testing. The results of the regression analysis corroborate the earlier findings, reaffirming the significance of the relationship between voter turnout and infant mortality rates.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the research findings suggest a nuanced relationship between voter turnout and infant mortality rates, highlighting the complexities underlying the interaction between political participation and public health outcomes. While the study initially anticipated a stronger correlation between higher voter turnout and reduced infant mortality, the empirical evidence demonstrates a more intricate association, emphasizing the need for comprehensive analyses to understand the multifaceted dynamics at play.

## References
